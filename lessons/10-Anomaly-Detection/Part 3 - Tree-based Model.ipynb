The goal is to learn to predict whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks. However, the 166 features that describe these molecules depend upon the exact shape, or conformation, of the molecule. Because bonds can rotate, a single molecule can adopt many different shapes. To generate this data set, all the low-energy conformations of the molecules were generated to produce 6,598 conformations. Then, a feature vector was extracted that describes each conformation. \n",
